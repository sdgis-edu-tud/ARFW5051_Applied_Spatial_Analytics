# ARFW0501 - Applied Spatial Analytics for Sustainable Urban Development

Welcome to the **Applied Spatial Analytics** course (ARFW0501) at **TU Delft**.  
This page collects key references and examples from previous editions. It is a space where you can explore how **spatial data and analytics** help tackle real-world urban and landscape challenges.

Whether you're coming from **Urbanism**, **Landscape Architecture**, or **Geomatics**, this material will guide you through how spatial thinking and analytical tools can support **evidence-based design and decision-making**.

## ðŸ“‚ FAIR Data  
- [Dataset 1](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/48e04672-93f4-49a4-9c7b-76c57a844e24/1)  
- [Dataset 2](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/924dc692-80e6-475f-8966-3bd672683f43/3)

These datasets have been published following **FAIR principles** â€” Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  
You can browse and download spatial data used in previous analyses to learn how to properly curate and document data for academic and professional use.
